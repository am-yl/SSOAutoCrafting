## FAQ

- *Is using these auto-clicker scripts considered cheating?*
- **Technically, no.** SSO staff is aware of the use of autoclickers and have regularly reassured concerned players that this is not considered cheating and is fine only when used for repetitive tasks. This does not give advantages in tournaments and races.

- *Can I edit the scripts/open a pull request?*
- **Yes!** Feel free to enhance them, or even just give suggestions by opening an issue.

- *This is awesome, can I do something to thank you?*
- You can open an issue just to thank us, we would be glad to see our work being useful to people! If you would like to donate, please consider donating to your local animal shelter.

- *Can you create a script to be better at racing/collect lights faster/train horses?*
- **No!** We like playing games fairly in respect of the other players, and for ourselves to enjoy the game as it is intended to be. According to SSO Staff statements and Terms of Services, we will not release hacks/scripts that give out advantages in races, tournaments, or players/horses development.

- *I need help! Can you help me?*
- **Maybe!** Please check if your problem has been already solved in another issue, and then open a new one describing correctly the issue(s) you are facing. We will try our best to help you!
